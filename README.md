# Arduino based Bluetooth Car

## This arduino project performs the following:

### 1) Digitally controls 4 independent motors, to turn them ON or OFF;
### 2) Control each motor speed independently;
### 3) Read bluetooth via serial communication, at 9600 baud;
### 4) Parse a basic JSON string from the bluetooth communication, enough to interpret commands;
### 5) Use the received bluetooth commands to control the motors;
### 6) Added a timer for each command, so it ends in 1 second.
### 7) Download and use a generic bluetooth remote control app, and this should work.
